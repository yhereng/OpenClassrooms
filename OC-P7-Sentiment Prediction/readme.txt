Project 7 - Using Deep Learning for Sentiment prediction
****************************************************************
This project aimed at develloping and deploying a sentiment analysis model based on twitter's database.
Three approachs were tested on Microsoft Azure:

1. Off the shelf Cognitive service API from Mircrosoft
2. Use of the Drag and Drop GUI in Azure Machine Learning Studio Classic
3. Use of Azure Machine Learning:
    - Developmnet of a RNN using LSTM cells on Keras
    - Test and Optimisation of preprocessings (lemmatization, stemming, Word embedding( FastText, GLoVe, Word2Vec)
    - Deployment of the model on Azure Container Instances
